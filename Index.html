      <h2>The Farm That Made Me Rethink Travel</h2>
      <p>
        I had always thought of France as wine, cities, and super chic experiences until I spent a weekend in a farm in Provence. <br><br>
        <strong>🌱 Trigger:</strong> I needed a break from the big city and found this stay on a local eco-retreat platform. <br>
        <strong>🏞 Conflict:</strong> The initial days were challenging—early mornings, unfamiliar tasks, and a digital detox that left me uneasy. <br>
        <strong>🔄 First Plot Point:</strong> As I engaged in harvesting olives and tending to the garden, I began to appreciate the rhythms of farm life. <br>
        <strong>🛠 Second Plot Point:</strong> Sharing meals prepared from our harvest fostered a sense of community and purpose. <br>
        <strong>😓 Anticlimax:</strong> A sudden mistral wind damaged part of the garden, dampening spirits. <br>
        <strong>🌌 Dark Moment:</strong> I questioned my ability to adapt and considered shortening my stay. <br>
        <strong>💡 Climax:</strong> That night, we lit candles, shared stories, and I felt more connected than ever. <br>
        <strong>🌅 Finale:</strong> Departing the farm, I carried with me not just memories but a renewed appreciation for sustainable living and the profound connections forged through shared purpose.
